**Project Upscale** is a ground-up redesign and redevelopment of my current portfolio website. This is a full recode of my website in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, moving away from no-code tools like Webflow or Framer that can be costly.

### 🎯 Goals
- ✨ **Simplicty** - Minimal dependencies, pure code that loads fast.
- 🆕 **Easily Updateable** - Easy to update & post articles, change text, and new portfolio items.
- 🧑‍🎨 **Aesthetic** -  Looks nice and has precise UX/UI that aren't distracting.

### 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: HTML, CSS, and JS
- **LLM AI**: GPT-4 Omni via Perplexity
- **Editor**: VS Code
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **Version Control**: GitHub
